# Oculi Pro v10.0
Oculi Pro is a paid mod menu for *Gorilla Tag* that is meant for more general-purpose usage. It is usable for a wide range of things, including:

- **Competitive (comp) advantage**: Oculi already comes with legit-type mods.
- **Ghost trolling**: Ghost Monke and Invis Monke work every new update.
- **Lagging**: Oculi has working lag guns and lag all mods that are mostly undetected.

Oculi Pro is only $5, with a free tier in progress.
